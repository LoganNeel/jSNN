# jSNN

A Java-based Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulation and training tool, aimed at advancing the development and experimentation of SNNs on standard computer hardware.

## Welcome

Welcome to **jSNN**, a project dedicated to making spiking neural networks more accessible and efficient for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts. Our goal is to provide a flexible, performant, and extensible framework to simulate and train SNNs using Java, with the option to leverage native C++ modules for critical performance optimizations.

Spiking Neural Networks represent a more biologically plausible form of neural computation compared to traditional artificial neural networks, potentially enabling breakthroughs in energy-efficient AI, neuromorphic computing, and real-time processing.
